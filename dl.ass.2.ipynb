    "\n",
    "The structure of an artificial neuron is similar to a biological neuron in that it receives input, processes that input, and produces an output. However, artificial neurons lack the complexity and intricacies of biological neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of an artificial neuron are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs: An artificial neuron receives one or more input signals. Each input is associated with a weight that determines its significance or contribution to the neuron's output. The inputs can represent features or attributes of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights: Weights are numerical values associated with each input signal. They indicate the strength or importance of the input signal in influencing the neuron's output. Weights can be adjusted during the learning process to optimize the neuron's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summation Function: The inputs, along with their respective weights, are summed together using a summation function. The summation function calculates the weighted sum of the inputs and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation Function: The weighted sum from the summation function is then passed through an activation function. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the neuron's output. It determines whether the neuron should be activated and to what extent based on the input. Common activation functions include the step function, sigmoid function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh (hyperbolic tangent) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias: Bias is an additional parameter added to the neuron's computation. It serves as an offset or threshold, allowing the neuron to fire even when all the input signals are relatively small. Bias helps the neuron to capture and model patterns that may not be possible without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: The activation function's output represents the output of the artificial neuron. It can be binary (e.g., 0 or 1) or continuous (e.g., a real-valued number).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, an artificial neuron takes inputs, applies weights and biases, performs a summation, passes the result through an activation function, and produces an output. The weights and biases are adjusted during the training process to optimize the neuron's behavior and enable it to learn and make predictions on new data."

    "Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperbolic tangent function is similar to the sigmoid function but produces an output between -1 and 1. It is also commonly used in hidden layers.\n",
    "Like the sigmoid function, the tanh function has a smooth derivative, making it suitable for gradient-based optimization. However, it also suffers from the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a popular activation function used in deep learning models. It is defined as f(x) = max(0, x), where x is the input.\n",
    "ReLU is computationally efficient and helps address the vanishing gradient problem by avoiding saturation for positive inputs. It introduces sparsity by setting negative values to zero.\n",
    "However, ReLU can suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where some neurons become non-responsive and output zero for any input below zero. Variants like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU have been proposed to mitigate this issue."
